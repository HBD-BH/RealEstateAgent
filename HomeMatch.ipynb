    "# Personalized Real-Estate Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a personalized real-estate agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "1. After configuration, we first generate and save some fictitious real-estate listings to choose from. (You can skip this step, if you want to)\n",
    "2. Next, we store them in a Vector Database (`chromadb`)\n",
    "3. We then generate user preferences. You can use the hardcoded question-answer pairs or give your own answers by setting `COLLECT_USER_PREFERENCES = True` in the configuration section\n",
    "4. Next, we recommend a suitable listing via a similarity search on the vector database\n",
    "5. We then pass the recommended listing to an LLM in order to re-write it based on the given user preferences (from step 3)\n",
    "6. Finally, we compare the old and new listings to make sure no factual information has been altered and the human preferences have indeed been taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preliminaries\n",
    "In order to run this notebook, make sure\n",
    "- to have the packages from `requirements.txt` installed\n",
    "- to have a `.env` file including at least `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_BASE` variables defined. You need to provide valid OpenAI credentials in order to query the OpenAI models in the code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some hints\n",
    "- If you just want to see the personalization part, you can skip the two first cells in the \"Generating Real Estate Listings\" section. \n",
    "- Please also find some ideas for improvements at the very end of the notebook.\n"
